# 🎯 WellPack Prediction Event

> 🚀 Event-aware campaign prediction tool for WellPack
> 📅 Integrates local and national events to optimize SMS and RCS marketing timing
> ⚙️ Built with Next.js for the interface and Python for data analysis

---

## 📖 Overview

**WellPack Prediction Event** is a hybrid **web + data science project** designed to enhance WellPack’s campaign prediction capabilities.

The core idea is simple: **campaign performance depends on context**.
Real-world events such as sports matches, cultural festivals, or public events strongly influence user attention and engagement.

This project combines:

* A **Next.js web interface** deployed on Vercel
* A **Python-based analysis layer** that studies event impact on campaign performance

Example:

* ⚽ A fast-food campaign sent before a football match may perform better
* 🏡 A real-estate campaign at the same time may be ignored

The system is designed to **account for these effects automatically**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Integrate real-world event data into campaign prediction logic
* Detect relevant local or national events for a given campaign date
* Evaluate event impact by business sector
* Recommend optimal sending windows and messaging context
* Provide a clean and reusable project structure suitable for production

---

## 🧠 Methodology

1. **Data Exploration**
   Historical campaign data is explored using Python and Jupyter notebooks

2. **Event Context Analysis**
   Events are categorized (sports, culture, public events) and mapped to campaign sectors

3. **Impact Reasoning**
   Rules and metrics are defined to estimate positive or negative impact

4. **Visualization & Interpretation**
   Results are visualized and summarized to support decision making
